# Overview

### RisingSeeds is a community-driven platform that curates crypto-related products, projects, and information.

#### Mission and Vision

What are we doing, and why are we doing it.

Realizing the potential application of blockchain and similar technologies can help people around the world discover legitimate and awesome blockchain projects that will shape the world for the better.

#### Problem

* There isn't a proper place where people can discover legitimate blockchain projects \(besides ICO rating sites and calendars\)
* ICO calendars are filled with questionable projects
* Too much misinformation and fake news to pump the value of tokens / coins
* Newcomers do not know how to distinguish between good & bad project. Often fall prey to cool landing pages and good media presence.
* No clear guidelines or best practices to use blockchain applications and crypto wallet \(also not intuitive\)
* Blockchain technical stuff is super boring to read \(which makes it hard to distinguish between real vs fake tech sometimes\)
* information and knowledge is scattered through Telegram chats and Facebook groups.
* Transparency on ICO company's spendings and progress are up to company's disclosure

#### Solution

* Build a community that's passionate about blockchain projects. Also serve as a place where people can discuss openly about the project.
* Helps community engage in relevant discussions with project founders.
* Have small digestible learning "paths" to help users understand blockchain concepts
* Infographics and visualizations make concepts much easier to grasp.
* Community or qualified users who had completed learning paths "paths" and earned "badges" can critique legitimacies of information or projects and earn rewards.
* Establish guides and best practices on how to use blockchain products.
* Initiate community driven criteria on how to distinguish between good & bad projects.

#### Target Users

* People who are interested in learning and discovering blockchain products.

#### User acquisition strategies

#### Gamification

* Encourage good project/content & discourage bad projects
* More points/token user accumulate should allow user to accomplish specialize things.

#### What do users want?

#### Proposed Ideas

* Jury voting systems
  * Partnering up with known crypto people to critic the project.
  * Or we can provide a "Be a jury" form.
  * Jury can earn more points by doing reviews for the project.
* Criteria
  * We can set "Pros" and "Cons" of the product based on jury's judgement.
* Comments
  * Comment section for all users which includes like and dislike for each comment.
* Screenshots
  * Screenshot of the actual app or project.
* Submit your project
  * This will serves as Sign up for all tech startup/project owner too.
